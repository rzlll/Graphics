# Computer Graphics


### Build the project using CMake:

    .\scripts\run_assignment.bat a1 1 [Windows]
    ./scripts/run_assignment.sh a1 1 [Linux/Mac]

This will:

- Compile the code
- Popup a window and show an OpenGL window


### Build

The build step can be done through cmake as well. In the `build` folder, run 

    cmake --build . --config Release
    
This will build all assignments and examples.
    
For more details, you can look at the `setup` and `run_assignment` scripts!
